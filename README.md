## About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to the [freeCodeCamp Daily Coding Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/).

**The Twist:**
While these challenges are typically solved in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript, I have chosen to implement them in **C**.

### Why C?
I am a computer systems engineering student. My goal is not just to solve the algorithmic logic, but to master **low-level programming concepts**. By solving these problems without the "superpowers" of high-level languages like Python and JavaScript, I am forcing myself to handle:

* **Manual Memory Management:** `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
* **Pointer Arithmetic:** Direct memory manipulation.
